PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
In this assignment, we will explore GAD, the Genetic Association Database (Becker et al., 2004). In the process we’ll re-discover some possible biological connections between seemingly disparate diseases. While we sometimes think of genetic diseases as being associated with a single faulty gene, the truth is much more complex. Most diseases are “multi-genic” meaning that there are many genes which have been linked to the disease or disease phenotype. To say that there is a link or association means that some particular research study found a statistically-significant connection between some variation of a gene, and the occurrence of a disease phenotype – without necessarily identifying the underlying biological basis for the connection. The association may be limited to a particular population (Japanese, American Indian, etc.) and the association may only suggest some increased probability of acquiring the disease. There may be other, as yet unknown connections with environmental factors such as diet which have yet to be teased out.

The GAD data set has the following columns:
- gad_id – The table’s primary key
- association – Whether there is a positive association (‘Y’)
- phenotype – The name of the disease or “phenotype”
- disease_class – The disease class (e.g., NEUROLOGICAL)
- chromosome – The chromosome on which the gene resides
- chromosome band – A descriptor for the chromosomal region
- dna_start – Where on the chromosome the gene begins
- dna_end – Where on the chromosome the gene ends
- gene – The official gene symbol
- gene_name – The gene’s full name
- reference – The research paper where the association was reported
- pubmed_id – Publication identifier (PubMed)
- year – Year of publication
- population – The population associated with study

Import the GAD data (gad.csv) into new schema called gad with a single table, also called gad. Then open the attached script and answer each question with a SQL query.

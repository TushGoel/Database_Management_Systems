# Assignment - 1

Q-1: In big data environments, analysts are constantly writing ad hoc database queries to obtain general table statistics for validation, trend analysis, or to simply gain a deeper understanding of their data. Consider the file loans.csv attached to this assignment. Each row is a loan applicant with various attributes. The last column indicates whether the applicant was approved for a loan. Imagine you live back in the old days before databases. Write a program in Java, Python, or a language of your choice that outputs a single table that displays for each distinct level of education:

• Number of applicants
• Min, max, and average balance (among applicants of a given education level)
• Number of loans approved, rejected, and the probability of being approved.
